# Sublime Text 3 Snippets
Sublime Text 3 snippets i created for myself. Because every key-stroke matters!

# How to use
Download any of the snippets you want to your `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User` directory.

The trigger to each command is the name of the file. For example, if a file is `vtmpl.sublime-snippet`, then the command to trigger it will be `vtmpl`

### PS:
I assume you're on a mac, otherwise, this isn't for you. Sorry.
